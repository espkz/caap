# CAAP
CS 329 project: Capture Assistant in Academic Papers


### Flask Site Running Instructions
- **If you're on PyCharm**: it should run even by running "Run", click on the site that is provided with the program and it should function.
- **If not**: going to terminal and typing `flask --app caap_home run` should cover it. Make sure you're in the right directory.


## TODO 
just stuff that I'm going to put down so I don't forget -Ellie

- [ ] Actually getting the PDF to the tool and running the program
- [ ] Also make sure redirect is okay
- [ ] Backend program is localized, find a way to make it accessible through a general machine
